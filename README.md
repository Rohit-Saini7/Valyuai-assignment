# Assignment for Web Development Internship at [Valyu.AI](https://www.valyu.ai/)

## Problem Statement

Create a React App, Following are the things required in the app -

 - Create a functional component in react in App.js and create a variable(say a1) using useState with initial value 0.
 - Now show this value using some paragraph tag.
 - Now, create 1 button that on press generates random integer values and assigns it to variable a1.
 - If on pressing the button the number generated is greater than 10 then show an alert saying target achieved or any similar statement
 - And the page should go to some other link say "/result" where you will show the last value generated on button press.
 - You need to use Redux for the transfer of value of a1 from one component to another.

CSS:
 - The whole struture on App.js should be in a colored border 
 - Paragraph and button should be next to each other 
 - There should be onHover and onPress color changes visible on button.
 - Use Styled-component to create the whole css part.
